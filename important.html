<h2> The Health Benefits of Sport </h2>
<p>One of the best reasons for kids and adults to play sport is for the incredible health benefits. With experts recommending 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week, it can be hard to find the time and motivation to fit this into a busy schedule. Sport makes it easy. Firstly, the sport tends to involve vigorous exercise, meaning you only need to aim for 75 minutes a week to get the same benefits. This makes achieving a healthy level of exercise easier.

<h2> Beyond Physical Health </h2>
<p>The physical importance of sports is well known but you might not be aware of how it impacts your mental health. Participating in physical activities has an incredibly beneficial effect on your happiness. This boost in happiness comes from a range of sources, both neurological and psychological.</p><br>

<h2>  Improved Social Skills </h2>
<p>For many people in the modern world, social interaction is lacking. Sport could be you’re way into making friends and reaping all the benefits that come with that. Outside of physical health, relationships are the most important foundation of happiness.

Team sports are particularly good for building social prowess. Whether you’re a socially awkward adult or want your child to improve their interpersonal skills, team games are one of the best tools for achieving this.</p><br>

<h2> The Role of Sport in Society </h2>
<p>The importance of sports doesn’t end in high school. Sporting events are often the center of communities, bringing people together. Every city in the world has its share of sports teams who compete for the entertainment of thousands of spectators. For many, watching your team come rain or shine is the most important part of the week. Like Sunday church, a trip to the stadium at the weekend brings meaning to the lives of millions.

Because of their popularity, sports teams are also crucial to local economies. Dallas Cowboys, for instance, employs over a thousand people, bringing in a revenue of $950. This is money that goes back into society via taxes and charity work. Every town and city across America have their own sports teams raising money, providing jobs, and keeping the local economy afloat.
